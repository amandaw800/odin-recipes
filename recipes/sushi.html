            <li>
                Cucumber
            </li>
            <li>
                Avacado
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.

            </li>
            <li>
                Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.

            </li>

        </ol>
